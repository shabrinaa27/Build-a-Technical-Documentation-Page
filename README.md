# Build a Tribute Page
##### Hello! It’s me! Someone who truly enjoys the learning journey on the path to becoming a great programmer.

This is my third project in my journey to earn the 'Responsive Web Design' certificate. Honestly, this one was more challenging than the previous projects. When I first saw the requirements, I didn’t start right away because I wasn’t sure I could do it. I even questioned whether I should continue learning programming. Sounds a bit dramatic, right? But thankfully, I pushed through and managed to complete it successfully. Am I happy? Absolutely! By the way, every time I finish a project, I’m amazed at myself. 'I can definitely do this!'

This time, I created a technical documentation page to provide instructions or references on a specific topic. For this project, I made a technical documentation page that explains general information about JavaScript and its fundamentals. Here, I’m sharing my code for this project.

Enjoy!
